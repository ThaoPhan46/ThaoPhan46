<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Thao Phan, a web developer.</p>

<p>I've been working as a web developer for a few months now, and I'm passionate about everything that goes into making websites work well and look beautiful. The web is my passion because it's where I can find the most exciting projects to work on. It's also where I get to express my creativity in ways that are hard to find elsewhere.</p>
    
<p>I love working with clients who want something more than just another website; they want their site to be more than just another website. They want it to be memorable, engaging, and valuableâ€”and that's where I come in!</p>
